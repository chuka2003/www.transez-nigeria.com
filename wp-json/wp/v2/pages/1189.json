The 800va Su-Kam inverter is a 12V inverter, which means that it uses a battery bank of one 12v battery. The 200Ah battery capacity is recommended,\u00a0but other battery capacities below or above 200Ah will also work. Lower capacities (say 100Ah), however, mean less power storage and less backup performance.<\/address>\n<address>\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>Built by Su-Kam Power Systems Ltd, a leading manufacturer of inverters and power backup systems, the Su-Kam 800VA\/12V unit offers the same ruggedness of the entire range. With a solid 1 year manufacturer&#8217;s warranty and its outstanding after-sales support (the Su-Kam Service Center is effectively equipped with spares and service engineers), the Su-Kam inverter brand is one you rely on for performance and peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>The Su-Kam 800va Falcon unit is also labelled a Home UPS. What this means is that this inverter unit has been designed to offer double functionality (inverter + UPS functions). It means that supply changeover is not only automatic but also without a break. In effect, your computer will run without re-booting and you will not need an extra UPS to achieve this. This Su-Kam inverter unit can actually serve as UPS, providing smooth continuous power supply and for an extended backup period far beyond what a normal UPS can offer.\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>\u00a0<\/address>\n<address>The Su-Kam 800va\/12v Falcon inverter is an advanced technology equipment, trusted for durable service. Even this small Su-Kam inverter unit offers a lot of value to bring huge lifestyle benefits to your family. Here&#8217;s some of what you enjoy with this 800va Su-Kam inverter:<\/address>\n<address>\n<ul>\n<li>High surge withstand capability (up to 300%)<\/li>\n<li>Provides pure sine wave power output (100% pure) &#8211; purer than power from grid (great for your sensitive equipment)<\/li>\n<li>Instant switchover: for the computer to run uninterrupted during power cuts, without rebooting.<\/li>\n<li>Provides extra long back-up for computers<\/li>\n<li>Space Saver &#8211; ideal for modern day households.<\/li>\n<li>User friendly display of alerts<\/li>\n<li>Aesthetically designed to blend into your upscale living environment.<\/li>\n<li>Option of castor wheel mounted trolley for easy movement.<\/li>\n<li>LED display to aid monitoring of performance<\/li>\n<li>Saves 40% electricity bill as compared to square wave inverter<\/li>\n<li>Incorporates smart overload sensing and short-circuit protection with auto reset.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In general, Su-Kam inverters mean a lot of comfort and new, hassle-free lifestyle because of the following benefits they bring:<\/p>\n<\/address>\n<address>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Extended <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Power<\/span> Backup:<\/b>\u00a0Get several hours of backup to meet your power need over most of the day.
