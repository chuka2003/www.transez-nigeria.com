This Su-Kam inverter capacity can support most appliances in the home or office, excluding only the heavy power users like air conditioners and deep freezers. While the manufacturer, Su-Kam,\u00a0actually\u00a0lists the 3.5kva\/48V Fusion Series as capable of supporting a small air conditioning unit, we\u00a0would rather you leave out your air conditioner or freezer from your load for this capacity. That will help achieve better power backup performance for your setup.The 3.5kva\/48V Su-Kam inverter provides a UPS mode to ensure that even the most sensitive equipment runs uninterrupted during system switchover to battery supply. As a result, your computer, plasma TV or other appliances continue to run without a break or reboot, even when no external UPS has been installed. When power fails, the switchover is not only automatic but also instant and seamless. This protects your precious equipment. With\u00a0the Su-Kam 3.5kva\/48V, you need no extra investment in a separate UPS as this unit is designed to serve both purposes.What&#8217;s more, the Su-Kam 3.5kva\/48V Fusion Series inverter is a Pure Sine Wave inverter, delivering the best quality of power that will keep your equipment protected. Use this inverter for sensitive equipment to enhance their durability.<\/address>\n<address>The Su-Kam 3.5kva\/48V inverter is powered by a battery bank of four 12V batteries. Battery capacity of up to 200Ah is recommended to provide adequate backup capacity, but lower capacities will also function, only providing less backup performance<b>.\u00a0<\/b>It is also advisable to acquire a\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mygadgetsmall.com\/shopping\/inverter-and-solar-accessories\/cat_78.html\" target=\"_blank\">four-battery rack<\/a>\u00a0(purchased separately), to neatly stack your 4 batteries. Also, consider to buy the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.mygadgetsmall.com\/shopping\/inverter-and-solar-accessories\/cat_78.html\" target=\"_blank\">Su-Kam battery equaliser<\/a>, which can help with the performance and durability of your batteries.The 3.5kva Su-kam unit is a relatively robust capacity, offering comfortable power backup of up to 12 hours on a typical household&#8217;s set of appliances, excluding the high consumption equipment previously referred to. At its level, it can take most appliances, deliver impressive backup and still keep implementation cost at a reasonable level. That makes this capacity one of the most popular of the Sukam range. Typical appliances include lighting, fans, DVDs\/LCDs, TVs, refrigerator, PCs, satellite decoders and similar household appliances.The 3.5kva Su-Kam fusion series inverter (commercial UPS) is engineered to deliver superior, dependable performance and will provide excellent return on investment. Su-Kam inverters offer advanced inverter technology that guarantees superior performance! They offer a level of protection against deep battery discharge, a critical factor for battery durability. They also offer in-built battery over-charge protection, another mechanism to protect your inverter batteries. The constant voltage and frequency system of Su-kam inverters ensure stable and efficient inverter performance and peace of mind for the user.<\/address>\n<address>Key product features of the Su-kam Fusion Series 3.5kva pure sine wave inverter\/commercial UPS:<\/address>\n<address>\n<ul>\n<li>DSP based PWM technology using MOSFET for high-speed processing<\/li>\n<li>Fuzzy Logic Charging algorithm suitable for all type of batteries, for best battery performance.<\/li>\n<li>Pure sine wave power output &#8211; 100% clean, regulated and totally stable, distortion-free power, ideal for sophisticated equipment.<\/li>\n<li>Instant switchover &#8211; your PC, for instance, will not reboot at power switch from mains to inverter<\/li>\n<li>Constant voltage and frequency.<\/li>\n<li>User friendly display and operation.<\/li>\n<li>Battery &amp; Load Level indications on LCD panel for ease of monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Inbuilt Multimeter for displaying Input Voltage, Frequency &amp; Battery Voltage.<\/li>\n<li>Auto self test on LCD Panel.<\/li>\n<li>LCD panel for remedial actions &amp; water topping alerts.<\/li>\n<li>Smart short circuit protection.<\/li>\n<li>Reverse battery polarity protection.<\/li>\n<li>Free of spikes and surges.<\/li>\n<li>Runs heavy loads.<\/li>\n<li>In built TDR point for compressor based applications.<\/li>\n<li>Power fail duration on LCD panel.<\/li>\n<li>World&#8217;s most advanced Commercial UPS based on the world&#8217;s most advanced DSP Sine Wave Technology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/address>\n<address>Su-kam inverters offer these benefits<b>:<\/b><\/address>\n<address>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Extended <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Power<\/span> Backup<\/b><b>:<\/b>\u00a0Get several hours of backup to meet your power need over most of the day.
