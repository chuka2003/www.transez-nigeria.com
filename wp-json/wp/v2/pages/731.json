This means the device must draw a higher amount of volt-amps (VA) compared to the actual load power it is delivering, which means its conversion of input power VA to output power VA is inefficient.<\/li>\n<li>The closer to a power factor\u00a0of 1 that the equipment has, the better the total current which has to be supplied will match the output from the source, and the more efficient it will be in its conversion of input power VA to output power VA.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/address>\n<address style=\"text-align: justify;\">Typically, the capital cost of correction of the power factor will be returned within 1-2 years via savings in the utility bill.<\/p>\n<p>The benefits provided by power-factor improvements are from the reduction of reactive power flow in the utility and plant distribution systems. That reduction may result in the following:<\/p>\n<p>a) lower utility costs if a power-factor clause is enforced or the utility charges for the kVA demand.<br \/>\nb) release of system electrical capacity (the system does not carry unnecessary vars).<br \/>\nc) voltage improvement (less reactive voltage drop).<br \/>\nd) lower system losses (upto 40%!).<\/p>\n<\/address>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u00a0 Here at Transez Nigeria Limited, we provide electronic means of Power Factor Correction with well-known benefits to electric power systems. \u00a0These benefits include power factor correction, poor power factor penalty utility bill reductions, voltage support, release of system capacity, and reduced system losses. \u00a0A high power factor signals maximum use of electrical power, while [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":618,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","template":"","meta":{"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/731"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=731"}],"version-history":[{"count":11,"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/731\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1395,"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/731\/revisions\/1395"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/618"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/www.transez-nigeria.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=731"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
